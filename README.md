##Features

This project makes it easy to:

Bootstrap your open source project properly
Make sure everyone gets what you're trying to archive with your project
Follow simple instructions for a perfect README.md

##Contributing

As I use this for my own projects, I know this might not be the perfect approach for all the projects out there. If you have any ideas, just open an issue and tell me what you think.

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make changes as you'd like. Pull requests are warmly welcome.

If your vision of a perfect README.md differs greatly from mine, it might be because your projects are for vastly different. In this case, you can create a new file README-yourplatform.md and create the perfect boilerplate for that.

E.g. if you have a perfect README.md for a Grunt project, just name it as README-grunt.md.
